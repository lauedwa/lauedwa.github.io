<title>Super Bowl Predictor</title>
<body>

<h1><b>WELCOME TO THE DEEP WEB</b> Nah jk just a Super Bowl Predictor By a Aussie calm down</h1>
<p>I Think either the Patriots or Green Bay will Win.</p>

<h2> REASONING </h2>

    <p> Tom Brady will come out of suspension, Guns BLAZING throw one to Gronk and <b>BOOM</b> Toms holding the Lombardi Trophy in his hands. But until then, Im hoping Garropollo will perform miracles</p>
    
<p> The Packers Might win because They are the Packers. They have Aaron Rodgers, Jordi Nelson, Randal Cobb, Clay Matthews, Eddie Lacie, ETC. Also, The Trophy is Named after one of their past coaches, Vince Lombardi. </p>

<h3>After Week 2</h3>

<p> Patriots, what a start to the season. Jimmy Garroppolo played as if Tom Brady were still there. He did something Tom Brady will never do.... avoid a sack. I felt really bad when he had to come off to get X-Rays after a hit from one of the Miami Dolphins Defensive linemen. the New QB I dont think will be very good. But... as a Pats fan i know what hapened to him when he got hit according to a source the scans came back without a Fractured shoulder. </p>

<h4>After Week 5</h4>

<p>Patriots, <b>BRADY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b></p>

<p>Green Bay, One loss TO THE VIKES?!?! well i cant say anything because the patriots lost to the Bills.</p>

<h5>After Week 6</h5>

<p>Green Bay, It would be nice if Aaron Rodgers could throw without getting picked</p>

<p>Patriots, <b>BRADYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b></p>
<h6>After Week 7</h6>

<p>Green Bay, Aaron Rodgers can throw, Eddie Lacy even Fatter.
    
    
     

Patriots, <b>BRADYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!</b> Ive really got to stop doing that XD</p>
